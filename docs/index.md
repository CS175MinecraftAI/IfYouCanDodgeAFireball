# Welcome to the website of Team Fireballers!
We are a team from CS 175 (Project in AI) for the Spring 2017 quarter. We are working on Project IfYouCanDodgeAFireball.

## Project IfYouCanDodgeAFireball
They say if you can dodge a fireball, then you can dodge a regular ball. Project IfYouCanDodgeAFireball involves training an AI agent using the Minecraft
Malmo API to survive an attack from a Ghast.

### Ghast

Ghasts are aggressive monsters in Minecraft that will shoot fireballs at players on sight. If a fireball hits a player, the player takes damage.
Our goal is to create an AI agent than can survive as long as possible against an onslaught of fireballs from a Ghast.
