## Project IfYouCanDodgeAFireball
They say "if you can dodge a fireball, then you can dodge a regular ball." Project IfYouCanDodgeAFireball involves training an AI agent using the Minecraft
Malmo API to survive an attack from a Ghast.

## Ghast

Ghasts are aggressive monsters in Minecraft that will shoot fireballs at the player on sight. If a fireball hits a player, the player takes damage.
Our goal is to create an AI agent than can survive as long as possible against an onslaught of fireballs from a Ghast.
