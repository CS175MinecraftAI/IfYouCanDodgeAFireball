## Project Summary
Our project is to create an AI agent in Minecraft that can survive against a ghast attack.

Ghasts are enemies in Minecraft that fly around and shoot fireballs at the player. We want to create an agent
that dodges fireballs or even fights back against the ghast by deflecting the fireballs by swinging a sword.

For input, we want to give the agent information about the state of the world such as ghast location, fireball location, player location and boundaries. We will also give the agent simple possible inputs such as moving left/right and attacking.

The agent should produce behavior that will allow the agent to survive against the ghast attack. This includes dodging a fireball, deflecting the fireball back at the ghast, and possibly damaging or destroying the ghast by deflecting the fireball.

## Algorithm Details
There are two ways we are thinking of achieving the goal of this project. One way is to use Q-learning (reinforcement learning) and the other is to use neural networks for image processing of the screen.

## Evaluation Plan
We will associate rewards
